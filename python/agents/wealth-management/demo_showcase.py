## üé§ DEMO TALKING POINTS

### Opening Hook
"What you're about to see is a sophisticated AI agent system using Google's ADK with Sequential, Parallel, Loop, and Master Orchestration patterns to handle complex wealth management workflows."

### For Each Demo
- **Pattern Recognition**: "Notice how this uses [pattern] to..."
- **Professional Application**: "In real wealth management, this would..."
- **Technical Excellence**: "The AI is intelligently routing between..."

### Closing Impact
"This demonstrates enterprise-level AI orchestration solving real-world financial challenges with multiple coordinated agents working together."

## üî• BACKUP DEMOS (if something breaks)

### Quick Tool Demo
"Let me show you individual tools working..."
- "Remember account TEST001"
- "Get portfolio summary for this account" 
- "Analyze market volatility with 5% threshold"

### Pattern Explanation
"Each workflow uses different ADK patterns:
- **Sequential**: Step-by-step coordinated execution
- **Parallel**: Simultaneous task processing  
- **Loop**: Continuous monitoring with auto-completion
- **Orchestration**: Intelligent routing between workflows"
